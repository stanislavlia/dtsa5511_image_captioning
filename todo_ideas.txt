1) Use the same logic of composing all 5 examples in a Y response (Not necessary)

2) Write logic for generating a caption 
3) Write file for training model specifying params as args
4) Write logic for tracking training in WandB 


#Ways to improve model

1) Scale up heads, embedding etc
2) Stack transformer blocks sequentially
3) Use another (larger) model with higher-dimensional embedding matrix for img

4) Use Vision Transformer instead of CNN
